505. The Maze II

There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the ball's start position, the destination and the maze, find the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included). If the ball cannot stop at the destination, return -1.

The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space. You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. The start and destination coordinates are represented by row and column indexes.

 Example 1:

Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Input 2: start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)
Input 3: destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (4, 4)

Output: 12

Explanation: One shortest way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right -> down -> right.
             The total distance is 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.

Example 2:

Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array

0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Input 2: start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)
Input 3: destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (3, 2)

Output: -1

Explanation: There is no way for the ball to stop at the destination.

 

Note:

There is only one ball and one destination in the maze.
Both the ball and the destination exist on an empty space, and they will not be at the same position initially.
The given maze does not contain border (like the red rectangle in the example pictures), but you could assume the border of the maze are all walls.
The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces, and both the width and height of the maze won't exceed 100.

```java
class Solution {

    private int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};

    public int shortestDistance(int[][] maze, int[] start, int[] destination) {

        if (maze == null || maze.length == 0) {
            return -1;
        }

        int row = maze.length;
        int col = maze[0].length;

        int[][] distance = new int[row][col];
    
        for (int[] eachRow : distance) {
            Arrays.fill(eachRow, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }

        // the distance of start point
        distance[start[0]][start[1]] = 0;

        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(start);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = queue.poll();

            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int x = curr[0] + dir[0];
                int y = curr[1] + dir[1];
                int count = 0;

                while (x >= 0 && x < row && y >= 0 && y < col && maze[x][y] == 0) {
                    x += dir[0];
                    y += dir[1];
                    count++;
                }

                // update the distance array
                // 注意在一般的广度优先搜索中，我们不会经过同一个节点超过一次，
                // 但在这道题目中，只要从起始位置到当前节点的步数 count 
                // 小于之前记录的最小步数 distance[i, j]，我们就会把 (i, j) 再次加入队列中
                if (distance[curr[0]][curr[1]] + count < distance[x - dir[0]][y- dir[1]]) {
                    distance[x - dir[0]][y - dir[1]] = distance[curr[0]][curr[1]] + count;
                    queue.offer(new int[]{x - dir[0], y - dir[1]});
                } 
            }
        }

        return distance[destination[0]][destination[1]] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : distance[destination[0]][destination[1]];
    }
}
