319. Buld Switcher

There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn off every second bulb.

On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb.

Return the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After the first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After the third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 
So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on.

Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: 0

Example 3:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1


Constraints:

0 <= n <= 109

```java
class Solution {
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {

        // 它的因子轮的操作可以改变它的状态
        // 例如4号灯泡，就只会在1,2,4这些轮改变，
        // 5号灯泡，就只会在1,5这两轮改变
        // 问题此时转化为了看1-n的所有的灯泡有几个因子

        int count = 0;

        // brute force 
        // 总结出来的一个规律是对于能开平方的数字，它的因子数一定是一个奇数
        // 而对于不能开平方数字，它的因子数为一个偶数

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (checkSquare(i)) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    private boolean checkSquare(int n) {
        if (n >= 0) {
            int sq = (int)Math.sqrt(n);
            return sq * sq == n;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
