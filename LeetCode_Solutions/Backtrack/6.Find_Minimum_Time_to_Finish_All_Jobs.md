1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs

===============

You are given an integer array jobs, where jobs[i] is the amount of time it takes to complete the ith job.

There are k workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned to exactly one worker. The working time of a worker is the sum of the time it takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal assignment such that the maximum working time of any worker is minimized.

Return the minimum possible maximum working time of any assignment.

##### Example 1:

Input: jobs = [3,2,3], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: By assigning each person one job, the maximum time is 3.

##### Example 2:

Input: jobs = [1,2,4,7,8], k = 2
Output: 11
Explanation: Assign the jobs the following way:
Worker 1: 1, 2, 8 (working time = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11)
Worker 2: 4, 7 (working time = 4 + 7 = 11)
The maximum working time is 11.

##### Constraints:

1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12
1 <= jobs[i] <= 107

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumTimeRequired(int[] jobs, int k) {

        Integer[] copy = new Integer[jobs.length];
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < jobs.length; i++) {
            copy[i] = jobs[i];
            sum += copy[i];
        }

        // sort jobs from large to small
        Arrays.sort(copy, (a, b) -> b - a);

        // possible result is between left and right
        int left = copy[0], right = sum;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left)/2;

            // 如果符合，可能还有更小的，需要继续找
            if (check(copy, k, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return left;
    }

    private boolean check(Integer[] jobs, int k, int limit) {
        // total assigned job for each worker
        int[] workloads = new int[k];

        // current index of jobs, start from 0
        return helper(jobs, workloads, 0, limit);
    }

    private boolean helper(Integer[] jobs, int[] workloads, int index, int limit) {
        if (index >= jobs.length) {
            return true;
        }

        int cur = jobs[index];

        // 遍历每一个worker
        for (int j = 0; j < workloads.length; j++) {
            if (workloads[j] + cur <= limit) {
                workloads[j] += cur;
                if (helper(jobs, workloads, index+1, limit)) {
                    return true;
                }
                workloads[j] -= cur;
            }

            if (workloads[j] == 0) {
                break;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
