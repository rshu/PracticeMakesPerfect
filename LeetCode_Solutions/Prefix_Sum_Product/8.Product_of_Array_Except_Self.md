238. Product of Array Except Self

===============

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

##### Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

##### Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
    
        int[] res = new int[nums.length];
        res[0] = 1;

        // prefix product
        // product before current number
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            res[i] = res[i-1] * nums[i-1];
        }

        int R = 1;
        // postfix product
        // product after current number
        for (int i = nums.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            res[i] = res[i] * R;
            R *= nums[i];
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
