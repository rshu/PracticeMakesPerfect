773. Sliding Puzzle

===============

On a 2x3 board, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5, and an empty square represented by 0.

A move consists of choosing 0 and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].

Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return -1.

##### Examples:

Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.

Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.

Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
An example path:
After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]

Input: board = [[3,2,4],[1,5,0]]
Output: 14

##### Note:

board will be a 2 x 3 array as described above.
board[i][j] will be a permutation of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

```java
class Solution {

    // 0 1 2
    // 3 4 5
    // 表示每个index的character的邻居
    int[][] neighbors = {{1,3}, {0,4,2}, {1,5}, {0,4}, {1,3,5}, {2,4}};

    public int slidingPuzzle(int[][] board) {

        int row = 2, col = 3;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                sb.append(board[i][j]);
            }
        }

        String start = sb.toString();
        String target = "123450";

        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        queue.offer(start);
        visited.add(start);

        int step = 0;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();

            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                String cur = queue.poll();

                if (cur.equals(target)) {
                    return step;
                }

                // 找到数字 0 的索引
                int pos = cur.indexOf('0');

                for (int neighbor : neighbors[pos]) {
                    String newBoard = swap(cur, neighbor, pos);

                    if (!visited.contains(newBoard)) {
                        visited.add(newBoard);
                        queue.offer(newBoard);
                    }
                }
            }

            step++;
        }

    return -1;
    }

    public String swap(String str, int src, int dst) {
        char[] arr = str.toCharArray();
        char temp = arr[src];
        arr[src] = arr[dst];
        arr[dst] = temp;
        return new String(arr);
    }
}
