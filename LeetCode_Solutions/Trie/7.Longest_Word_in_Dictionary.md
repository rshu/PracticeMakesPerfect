720. Longest Word in Dictionary

===============

Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words.

If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.

##### Example 1:

Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".

##### Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".

##### Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 30
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

```java
class Solution {

    public class TrieNode {
        TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[26];
        boolean isWord = false;
        String word;
    }

    TrieNode root = new TrieNode();
    private int maxLength = 0;
    private String ans = "";

    public String longestWord(String[] words) {
        for (String word : words) {
            insert(word);
        }

        search(root, 0);
        return ans;
    }

    public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode cur = root;

        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            int c = word.charAt(i) - 'a';

            if (cur.children[c] == null) {
                cur.children[c] = new TrieNode();
            }

            cur = cur.children[c];
        }

        cur.isWord = true;
        cur.word = word;
    }

    public void search(TrieNode cur, int curDepth) {

        if (curDepth > 0 && !cur.isWord) {
            return;
        }

        if (curDepth > maxLength) {
            maxLength = curDepth;
            ans = cur.word;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (cur.children[i] != null) {
                search(cur.children[i], curDepth+1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
