274. H-Index

===============

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n − h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

##### Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

##### Example 2:

Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1

##### Constraints:

n == citations.length
1 <= n <= 5000
0 <= citations[i] <= 1000

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {

        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int len = citations.length;

        int h = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (citations[i] >= len - i) {
                h = Math.max(h, len - i);
            }
        }

        return h;
    }
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {

        // 计数排序
        int len = citations.length;
        int[] count = new int[len+1];

        // H 指数不可能大于总的论文发表数
        for (int citation : citations) {
            if (citation >= len) {
                count[len]++;
            } else {
                count[citation]++;
            }
        }

        int total = 0;
        for (int i = len; i >= 0; i--) {
            total += count[i];

            if (total >= i) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```
