750. Number of Corner Rectangles

===============

Given an m x n integer matrix grid where each entry is only 0 or 1, return the number of corner rectangles.

A corner rectangle is four distinct 1's on the grid that forms an axis-aligned rectangle. Note that only the corners need to have the value 1. Also, all four 1's used must be distinct.

##### Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0,1],[0,0,0,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one corner rectangle, with corners grid[1][2], grid[1][4], grid[3][2], grid[3][4].

##### Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 9
Explanation: There are four 2x2 rectangles, four 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles, and one 3x3 rectangle.

##### Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Rectangles must have four distinct corners.

##### Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
The number of 1's in the grid is in the range [1, 6000].

```java
class Solution {
    public int countCornerRectangles(int[][] grid) {

        // 角矩形指四个角上均为1的矩形
        if (grid == null || grid.length <= 1 || grid[0].length <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }

        int res = 0;
        int row = grid.length;
        int col = grid[0].length;

        for (int r1 = 0; r1 < row; r1++) {
            for (int r2 = r1 + 1; r2 < row; r2++) {
                // 统计满足条件的列的个数
                int count = 0;

                for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                    if (grid[r1][j] == 1 && grid[r2][j] == 1) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }

                // 从中选两列构成矩阵，方法为Cn2
                res += count * (count -1)/2;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
