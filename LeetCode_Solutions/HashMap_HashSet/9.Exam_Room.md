855. Exam Room

===============

In an exam room, there are n seats in a single row, numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1.

When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person.  If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number.  (Also, if no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.)

Return a class ExamRoom(int n) that exposes two functions: ExamRoom.seat() returning an int representing what seat the student sat in, and ExamRoom.leave(int p) representing that the student in seat number p now leaves the room.  It is guaranteed that any calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) have a student sitting in seat p.

##### Example 1:

Input: ["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"], [[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]]
Output: [null,0,9,4,2,null,5]
Explanation:
ExamRoom(10) -> null
seat() -> 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.
seat() -> 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
seat() -> 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
seat() -> 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
leave(4) -> null
seat() -> 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.

##### Note:

1 <= n <= 109
ExamRoom.seat() and ExamRoom.leave() will be called at most 104 times across all test cases.
Calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) are guaranteed to have a student currently sitting in seat number p.

    TreeSet<Integer> set;
    int n;

        this.set = new TreeSet<>();

    }
    
    public int seat() {
        int curSeat = 0;

        if (set.size() > 0) {
            // 初始化，定义当前到最近学生的最远距离是第一个学生到座位0的距离
            int maxDist = set.first() - 0;
            Integer prev = null;

            // 遍历每个学生，计算相邻学生之间的距离
            // 更新dist
            for (Integer s : set) {
                if (prev == null) {
                    prev = s;
                } else {
                    // 相邻学生距离的一半
                    int curDist = (s - prev)/2;

                        maxDist = curDist;
                        curSeat = prev + curDist;
                    }

                    // 更新prev指针
                    prev = s;
                }
            }

            // 如果座位末尾到最后一个学生之间的距离比较大
            // 则坐在最后一个位置
            if (n-1 - set.last() > maxDist) {
                curSeat = n -1;
            }
        }

        // 学生入座，加入TreeSet
        set.add(curSeat);
