1711. Count Good Meals

===============

A good meal is a meal that contains exactly two different food items with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.

You can pick any two different foods to make a good meal.

Given an array of integers deliciousness where deliciousness[i] is the deliciousness of the ith item of food, return the number of different good meals you can make from this list modulo 109 + 7.

Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.

##### Example 1:

Input: deliciousness = [1,3,5,7,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).
Their respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.

##### Example 2:

Input: deliciousness = [1,1,1,3,3,3,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.

##### Constraints:

1 <= deliciousness.length <= 105
0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 220

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPairs(int[] deliciousness) {

        int mod = (int)1e9+7;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int maxNum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int num : deliciousness) {
            maxNum = Math.max(num, maxNum);
        }

        int count = 0;

        for (int num : deliciousness) {
            // 遍历所有可能的2的幂
            for (int sum = 1; sum <= maxNum * 2; sum <<= 1) {
                if (map.containsKey(sum - num)) {
                    count = (count + map.get(sum - num)) % mod;
                }
            }

            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```
