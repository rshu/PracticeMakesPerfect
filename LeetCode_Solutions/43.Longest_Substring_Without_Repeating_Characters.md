3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Example 4:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0


Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {

        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        // two pointers
        int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        while (p1 < s.length() && p2 < s.length()) {
            if (!set.contains(s.charAt(p2))) {
                set.add(s.charAt(p2));
                p2++;
                ans = Math.max(ans, p2 - p1);
            } else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(p1));
                p1++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
