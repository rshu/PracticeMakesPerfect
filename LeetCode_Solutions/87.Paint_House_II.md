265. Paint House II

There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
             Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.

Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCostII(int[][] costs) {

        if (costs == null || costs.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int len = costs.length;
        int k = costs[0].length;

        if (len == 1 && k == 1) {
            return costs[0][0];
        }

        // dp[i][j] 指第i个house用第j种color喷涂的最小cost
        int[][] dp = new int[len+1][k];

        for (int i = 1; i <= len; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                // dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][p] + cost[i-1][j]) 
                // 状态转移方程 p!=j
                dp[i][j] = findMin(dp, i-1, j) + costs[i-1][j];
            }
        }

        // k+1不存在，所以找最后一行所有数的最小值
        return findMin(dp, len, k+1);
    }

    // 找到第i行除了第j个数的最小值
    private int findMin(int[][] dp, int i, int j) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int k = 0; k < dp[0].length; k++) {
            if (k != j) {
                min = Math.min(min, dp[i][k]);
            }
        }
        return min;
    }
}
```
