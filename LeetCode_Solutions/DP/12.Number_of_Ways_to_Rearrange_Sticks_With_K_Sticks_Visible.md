1866. Number of Ways to Rearrange Sticks With K Sticks Visible

===============

There are n uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from 1 to n. You want to arrange the sticks such that exactly k sticks are visible from the left. A stick is visible from the left if there are no longer sticks to the left of it.

For example, if the sticks are arranged [1,3,2,5,4], then the sticks with lengths 1, 3, and 5 are visible from the left.
Given n and k, return the number of such arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

##### Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: [1,3,2], [2,3,1], and [2,1,3] are the only arrangements such that exactly 2 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.

##### Example 2:

Input: n = 5, k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the only arrangement such that all 5 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.

##### Example 3:

Input: n = 20, k = 11
Output: 647427950
Explanation: There are 647427950 (mod 109 + 7) ways to rearrange the sticks such that exactly 11 sticks are visible.

##### Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= k <= n

```java
class Solution {
    public int rearrangeSticks(int n, int k) {

        int mod = (int)1e9+7;

        // 前i根木棍能看到j个木棍的组合
        long[][] dp = new long[n+1][k+1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        /*
        两种情况：
        1. 如果第i根能被看到，最后一根木棍的长度一定为 i，
        因此前 i-1 根木棍的长度恰好为 1, 2, 。。。 i-1 的一个排列，
        并且可以看到其中的 j−1 根木棍
        2. 如果第i根不能被看到，最后一根木棍的长度为 [1,i−1] 中的某个值,
        共i-1种情况
        假设这个值为 x，那么前 i−1 根木棍的长度为 1,⋯,x−1,x+1,⋯,i 的一个排列，
        并且可以看到其中的 j 根木棍。
        */
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-1][j];
                dp[i][j] %= mod;
            }
        }

        return (int)dp[n][k];
    }
}
```
