740. Delete and Earn

===============

Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

##### Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points.
6 total points are earned.

##### Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.

##### Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 104

```java
class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {

        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }

        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        // 构造新数组
        for (int num : nums) {
            max = Math.max(max, num);
        }

        int[] arr = new int[max + 1];

        // 统计每个位置的个数
        for (int num : nums) {
            arr[num]++;
        }

        // dp[i]表示在前i个数能获取的最大得分
        int[] dp = new int[max + 1];

        dp[1] = arr[1] * 1;
        // 要么选第一个数，删掉第二个数
        // 要么选第二个数，删掉第一个数
        dp[2] = Math.max(dp[1], arr[2] * 2);

        // 要么取前一个数，或者取当前数
        // 这种情况不用考虑i+1，因为涉及不到
        for (int i = 3; i <= max; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + arr[i] * i);
        }

        return dp[max];
    }
}
```
